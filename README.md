This repository includes the scripts used to compute the analysis in our technical comment published in Science.
The authors are listed below:
Arthur Bayle, Simon Gascoin, Bradley Z. Carlson, Christophe Randin, Edoardo Cremonese, Gianluca Filippa, Philippe Choler

Arthur Bayle conduct most of the analysis with the help of Simon Gascoin. The manuscript was written and improved by all co-authors.

This repository includes two files :
- The Google Earth Engine script based on the script of Rumpf et al. (2022) but modified to extract the 'Image Count' more efficiently.
- The R code used to conduct the analysis and produce the figures.
